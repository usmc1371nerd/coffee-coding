        still in the beginning stages of this project/ journey.. This is not built by

        Hopefully people with a lot of experience joins or extends some helping knowledge
        but this is and will always be for everyone. From someone just interested in code all the way to a jedi
        developer. This is supposed to be a project to help build a community here in Birmingham
        for all developers or people interested in coding, programming, or web development(whatever you want to call it).
